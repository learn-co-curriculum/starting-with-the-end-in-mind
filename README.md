When designing your course, think of what you want your student to accomplish. 

At the end of each track, students works on a final test-driven project as well as an assessment that's more open-ended. The assessment will not have any tests. 

For example, after students finished learning the Sinatra web framework, they created a Twitter clone we called Fwitter. The goal was to build a full scale Sinatra application that used a sqlite database, ActiveRecord, RESTful routes, Sessions, and Login/Logout. Essentially this covered everything they had covered in Sinatra. 

The assessment that students worked on for this track was a content management system app that had the following requirements:

1. An MVC Sinatra Application.
2. ActiveRecord integrated with Sinatra.
3. Multiple Models.
4. At least one has_many relationship
5. user accounts. The user that created the content should be the only person who can modify that content
6. Models must have validations to ensure that bad data isn't created
7. Any validation failures must be shown to user with an error message

What is the final project and the final assessment that students will be working on at the very end of your course? This final project should be comprehensive and challenging enough for a student to be able to get a job as a junior developer in that particular topic. It should take between 10-20 hours for a student to complete, and we can adjust that length by simply adjusting the starter code that we’re giving students. 

Map out your final project. List the requirements and what students should be expected to do to build it. 

In this final projects, students will be able to:
1.
2.
3.
4.
etc.

Map out your assessment, and similarly, list out the requirements that need to be included in this project. 

Now that you have these projects ready, let’s think about your course as a map that guides your students to this project.
